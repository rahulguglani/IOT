# Introduction to Arduino Uno
 Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board, developed by Arduino.cc, based on the Atmega328 microcontroller and is marked as the first Arduino board developed(UNO means “one” in Italian).
The software used for writing, compiling & uploading code to Arduino boards is called Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which is free to download from Arduino Official Site.
* It has an operating voltage of 5V while the input voltage may vary from 7V to 12V.
* Arduino UNO has a maximum current rating of 40mA, so the load shouldn’t exceed this current rating or you may harm the board.
* It comes with a crystal oscillator of 16MHz, which is its operating frequency.
* Arduino Uno Pinout consists of 14 digital pins starting from D0 to D13.
* It also has 6 analog pins starting from A0 to A5.
* It also has 1 Reset Pin, which is used to reset the board programmatically. In order to reset the board, we need to make this pin LOW.
* It also has 6 Power Pins, which provide different voltage levels.
* Out of 14  digital pins, 6 pins are used for generating PWM pulses of 8-Bit resolution. PWM pins in Arduino UNO are D3, D5, D6, D9, D10 and D11.

# Arduino UNO
#### Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the [ATmega328P](https://github.com/IoT-Buzz/IoT/tree/main/Hardware/Arduino-UNO/Microcontroller)

The first Arduino project was started in Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in 2003 by David Cuartielles and Massimo Banzi with the intention of providing a cheap and flexible way for students and professionals to learn embedded programming.

  Arduino UNO is a very valuable addition in electronics that consists of a USB interface, 14 digital I/O pins(of which 6 Pins are used for PWM), 6 analog pins and an Atmega328 microcontroller. 
  It also supports 3 communication protocols named -
  * Serial
  * I2C
  * SPI protocol.

## Communication and Programming
Arduino Uno comes with the ability of interfacing with other Arduino boards, microcontrollers and computers. The Atmega328 placed on the board provides serial communication using pins like Rx and Tx.

The Atmega16U2 incorporated on the board provides a pathway for serial communication using USB com drivers. A serial monitor is provided on the IDE software which is used to send or receive text data from the board. If LEDs placed on the Rx and Tx pins will flash, they indicate the transmission of data.

Arduino Uno is programmed using Arduino Software which is a cross-platform application called IDE written in Java. The AVR microcontroller Atmega328 laid out on the base comes with built-in bootloader that sets you free from using a separate burner to upload the program on the board.

### Arduino UNO comes with 3 types of memories associated with it, named:
* Flash Memory: 32KB
* SRAM: 2KB
* EEPROM: 1KB

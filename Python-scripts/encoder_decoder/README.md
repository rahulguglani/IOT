# Encoder and Decoder
* This direcory contains 3 basic encoder functions and their respective decoder functions.
* All the encoding functions can be found in `encoder.py` and decoder functions in `decoder.py`
* These encoders are majorly used for data compression techniques.

## Encoder
* Has 3 encoding functions:
    * Binary encoder
    * Unary encoder
    * Elias Gamma encoder
* Each of these are separate functions are independent of one another.

## Decoder
* Has decoding functions for above mentioned encoding functions.
* Each of these are also separate functions are independent of one another.

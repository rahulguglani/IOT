# Soldering
<p>Soldering is the process of joining two or more electronic parts together by melting solder around the connection. Solder is a metal alloy and when it cools it creates a strong electrical bond between the parts. Even though soldering can create a permanent connection, it can also be reversed using a desoldering tool</p>

**` warning `** If you are a beginner and never used soldering iron before, prefer to use 25 Watt Soldering Iron , don't use more then that otherwise it will burn your components and can cause more damage to the person using it as well.

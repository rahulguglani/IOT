It is used for more refined project , it is a board with pre drilled holes with copper clad back in which we can insert differnt components and can solder them to make our desired circuit.     
There are different variety of perf board such as a strip board in which all the columns holes are connected with each other.

Perf board are used to make circuit which are fixed and more durable. It is used to make prototypes. we can connect differnt components via soledering directly on perfboard.  
it is not as much flexible and reusable as breadboard but we can design any circuit according to our need on it. connections are slightly difficult to change in perfboard.

The top and bottom holes of a row in a breadboard are connected horizontally, and the center part is connected vertically, as shown below:

Instead of directly joining wire with solder or twisting (which creates a mess) we can use a breadboard to make connections between different components .  
we generally put power and ground wires in the vertical rails so that we can easily power any component, and for connecting two or three wires together we use horizontal rows of the breadboard. we can also directly put some ic or development board in between of breadboard for easier connections.

breadboard is generally used for prototype and testing of project , or for less refined project.
benifits of using breadboard are :
1. Reusable 
2. Light weight
3. Inexpensive
4. Easy to use
5. Quick modification capability
6. Temporary prototype

## PRECAUTIONS
1. Do not connect it directly to the supply from switch board i.e. do not give it voltage from 
mains supply) because the closely situated connections may possibly create arcing or 
even dangerous short circuits and a fire.
2. Remember the outer body of breadboard is made up of plastic, so avoid exposing it to 
extreme heat.

## FUN FACT 
So why do we call this electronic “circuit builder” a breadboard?
<p>Many years ago, when electronics were big and bulky, people would grab their mom’s breadboard, a few nails or thumbtacks, and start connecting wires onto the board to give themselves a platform on which they build their circuits.</p>

<p>To make our work more pretty and refined we generally use pcb. it is much neater than breadboard and perfboard but is generally used for final design </p>
<p>For PCB first of all we have to create a gerber file which consist of design of the pcb and then we can order the pcb from any manufacturer.</p>

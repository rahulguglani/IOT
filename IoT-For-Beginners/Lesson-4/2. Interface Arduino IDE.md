## Overview

- **Toolbar :** You can find options here to create/upload new files and to run/compile run your code.
- **Text Editor :** This is the place where you would write your code.

## Main Menu

1. In sketchbook you can find the list of all the sketches/programs you have made
<br />
<p align = "center">

        alt = "Main Menu Labelled"
        title = "Main Menu Labelled"
    />
</p>

2. In Example Section you can find all the example programs related to installed libraries.
<br />

        src = "./assets/main_menu_examples.png"
        alt = "Main Menu Examples Tab"
        title = "Main Menu Examples Tab"
    />
</p>

<br /> <br />

## Board Selection

1. Select your type of microcontroller from here.
2. For working with different version of a microcontroller you have to select it’s type first.

</p>

- The serial monitor is the 'tether' between the computer and your Arduino : it lets you send and receive text messages, handy for debugging and also controlling the Arduino from a keyboard!

- After writing this, you command your arduino board to send/receive messages and that number 9600 means at which rate/pace you want to send/receive message.

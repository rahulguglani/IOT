Battery is one of the importan component in Electrical and Electronics system.  
A Battery is a chemical device that stores electrical energy in the form of chemicals and by means of electrochemical reaction, it converts the stored chemical energy into direct current (DC) electric energy.

Basically, all the electrochemical cells and batteries are classified into two types:

1. Primary (non-rechargeable)
2. Secondary (rechargeable)
Even though there are several other classifications within these two types of batteries, these two are the basic types. Simply speaking, Primary Batteries are non-rechargeable batteries i.e., they cannot be recharged electrically while the Secondary Batteries are rechargeable batteries i.e., they can be recharged electrically.

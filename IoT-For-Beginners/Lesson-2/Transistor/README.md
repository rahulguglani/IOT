# Transistor
we have seen a bit about transistor in lesson 1 here we are going to cover it in detail.

A transistor is a semiconductor device that comes with three terminals, where a small current at one terminal is used to control current at the other terminals. Transistors are mainly used for the amplification of electronic signals.  
BJTs are the bipolar junction transistors which use two charge carriers i.e. electrons and holes for electrical conduction. And BJTs are the current controlled devices where small current at one terminal is used to control large current at other terminals.

### Transistor as Switch

Depending on the applied voltage value at the base edge of the transistor, switching functionality takes place. When there is a good amount of voltage which is ~0.7V in between the emitter and the base edges, then the flow of voltage at the collector to emitter edge is zero. So, the transistor in this condition performs as a switch and the current that flows through the collector is considered as the transistor current.

In the same way, when there is no voltage applied at the input terminal, then the transistor functions in the cut-off region and functions as an open circuit. In this switching method, the connected load in contact with the switching point where this acts as a reference point. So, when the transistor moves into the ‘ON’ condition, there will be a flow of current from the source terminal to the ground via load.

### transistor as amplifier
One of the key characteristics of a transistor is that it can be used as an amplifier. Transistors can act as amplifiers while they are functioning in the active region or when it is correctly biased. The need for transistor as an amplifier arises when we want to increase or amplify the input signal. A transistor can take in a very small weak signal through the base junction and release the amplified signal through the collector.

# BASIC COMPONENTS
<p> In this lesson we are going to learn about basic components that make up our project. These Include :</p>

1. [MOTORS](https://github.com/IoT-Buzz/IoT/tree/main/IoT-For-Beginners/Lesson-2/motors)
2. [SWITCHES](https://github.com/IoT-Buzz/IoT/tree/main/IoT-For-Beginners/Lesson-2/switches)
3. [RELAY](https://github.com/IoT-Buzz/IoT/tree/main/IoT-For-Beginners/Lesson-2/Relay)
4. [POTENTIOMETER](https://github.com/IoT-Buzz/IoT/tree/main/IoT-For-Beginners/Lesson-2/potentiometer)
5. [TRANSISTOR](https://github.com/IoT-Buzz/IoT/tree/main/IoT-For-Beginners/Lesson-2/Transistor)
6. [BUZZER](https://github.com/IoT-Buzz/IoT/tree/main/IoT-For-Beginners/Lesson-2/Buzzer)
7. [BATTERIES](https://github.com/IoT-Buzz/IoT/tree/main/IoT-For-Beginners/Lesson-2/Batteries)

From these basic components we can start building fundamental projects and get started in field of iot.
Some projects from which you can learn are :

1. [Transistor projects](https://youtu.be/BEGmT-9GIeE)
2. [push button and arduino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Ynhqmvzoc)
3. [Arduino piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoXk6OL8GfQ)
4. [interfacing motor with arduino](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/arduino/arduino_dc_motor.htm)

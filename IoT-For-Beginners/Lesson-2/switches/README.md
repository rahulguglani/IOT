# Switches
A Switch is a device which is designed to interrupt the current flow in a circuit. In simple words, a Switch can make or break an electrical circuit. Every electrical and electronics application uses at least one switch to perform ON and OFF operation of the device.  
Basically, Switches can be of two types. They are:

1. Mechanical
2. Electronic

Commonly used mechanical switches are :

1. Push button
2. Slide Switches
3. Toggle switch
4. SPST
5. SPDT
6. DPDT

Commonly use electronic switches are :

1. Bipolar Transistor
2. Power Diode
3. Mosfet
4. IGBT

## fun project
`controlling dc motor ` using just a dc motor, dpdt switch and a battery you can control a dc motor in both the directions.

- This sensor has a transmitter and a receiver.
- The transmitter emits infrared radiations and if there is any object in front of the sensor that reflects the infrared radiations back to the receiver it will detect the change.
- If there is no object in front of the sensor it will always give an output of 1 or HIGH , but if the receiver receives infrared radiations, then its output changes to 0 or LOW.
- Interesting thing to note here is that fire also emits infrared radiations, so this sensor can also detect fire.

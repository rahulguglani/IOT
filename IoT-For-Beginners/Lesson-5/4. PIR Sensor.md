- PIR sensor is used for detecting infrared heat radiations. This makes them useful in applications involving detection of moving living objects that emit infrared heat radiations.

- Passive infrared sensor, mainly used for detecting motion of human within its range.

- The output (in terms of voltage) of PIR sensor is high when it senses motion; whereas it is low when there is no motion (stationary object or no object).

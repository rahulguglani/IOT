- ESP32 is a series of low-cost power systems on a chip microcontroller. 
- The ESP32 is an advanced version of the ESP8266 series. (NodeMCU).
- The ESP32 series is created and developed by Espressif Systems. 
- It contain both wifi and Bluetooth module and the speed is faster then esp8266

```
There are many models of esp32 in market, you can even find one in which you can connect camera module

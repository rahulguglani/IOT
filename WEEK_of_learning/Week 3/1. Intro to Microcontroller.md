## What is a microcontroller?
- A microcontroller is an *integrated circuit* ( IC ) that can be programmed to perform a set of functions to control a collection of electronic devices.

- The most important thing is that it is **programmable** . So one can program it according to the requirement and produce desired outputs .

## How is it different from a microprocessor?

| Microcontroller | Microprocessor |
| :-------------: | :----------: |
| Used to execute a single task within an application. | Used for big applications. |
| Its designing and hardware cost is low.	| Its designing and hardware cost is high. |
| Easy to replace. | Not so easy to replace. |
| It is built with CMOS technology, which requires less power to operate. | Its power consumption is high because it has to control the entire system. |
| It consists of CPU, RAM, ROM, I/O ports. | It doesnâ€™t consist of RAM, ROM, I/O ports. It uses its pins to interface to peripheral devices. |

And most importantly, microcontrollers are used in **Arduino** as well. 
If you don't know about Arduino for now, <a href = "https://github.com/hardikchopra242/IOT/blob/main/WEEK_of_learning/Week%203/2.%20Intro%20to%20Arduino.md"> see this </a>

## What is Arduino?
- Arduino is an *open-source* electronics platform based on easy-to-use **hardware** & **software**.

- Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
- You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board.

- Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (microcontroller) and a piece of software or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.

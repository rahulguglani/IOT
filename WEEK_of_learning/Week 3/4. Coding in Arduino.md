## C v/s Arduino Code

- The main difference from C or C++ is that you wrap all your code into **2 main functions**. You can have more than 2, of course, but any Arduino program must provide at least those 2.

- One is called `setup()`, the other is called `loop()`. The first is called once, when the program starts, the second is repeatedly called while your program is running.

- We donâ€™t have a `main()` function like in C/C++ as the entry point for a program. Once you compile your sketch, the IDE will make sure the end result is a correct C++ program and will basically add the missing code by preprocessing it

## Some basic Arduino Functions

Arduino software provides a set of functions for controlling the Arduino board and performing computations.

| Name | Description |

## Hello World of Hardware

- Your first Arduino program will surely involve making a LED turn on, and then turn off. 
- To do so, you will use the `pinMode()`, `delay()` and digitalWrite() functions, along with some constants like HIGH, LOW, OUTPUT.

### Arduino Code

```cpp
#define LED_PIN 13

void setup() {
    //configure pin 13 to be a digital output
    pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
    //Turn on the LED
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);

    //Wait for 1000 millisecond (1 second)
    delay(1000);

    //Turn off the LED
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);

    //Wait for 1 second
    delay(1000);
}
```
